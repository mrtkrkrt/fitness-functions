## Fitness Functions in System Architecture
Welcome to the Fitness Functions in System Architecture repository! This project demonstrates how to use fitness functions to ensure a resilient and well-maintained software architecture, with examples in Java.

### ðŸ“‹ About
Fitness functions are essential for maintaining architectural integrity by setting clear boundaries for code structure and design. Just as physical fitness plans aim for strength and endurance, fitness functions help our system stay "fit" by protecting it from unexpected changes.

###  Features
Architectural Constraints: Define and enforce restrictions in code structure, package hierarchy, and more.
Error Prevention: Safeguards against common mistakes by establishing automated checks.
Continuous Validation: Ensures alignment with design principles throughout the development lifecycle.

### ðŸ’» Examples
This repository includes Java-based examples covering key fitness functions, such as:

* Dependency Constraints: Avoids circular dependencies and maintains clean modular boundaries.
* Code Style Checks: Enforces naming conventions, package organization, and consistent code style.
* Performance and Scalability: Ensures components meet performance expectations as the system grows.
